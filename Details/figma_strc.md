2. Page 2 â€“ Architecture & Workflow
   o Frame 1: System Architecture (modules + interactions).
   o Frame 2: Updated Workflow Diagram (AI feedback, tracking).
   o Frame 3: Component Map (widgets to be used across screens).
3. Page 3 â€“ Wireframes (Low Fidelity)
   o Frame per Module:
   ï‚§ Login & Role Assignment.
   ï‚§ Dashboard Super Admin.
   ï‚§ Dashboard Company Admin.
   ï‚§ Dashboard Leader.
   ï‚§ Dashboard Supervisor.
   ï‚§ Employee Survey View.
   ï‚§ Action Plan Manager.
   ï‚§ AI Insights Panel.
   ï‚§ Microclimate Live Evaluation.
   ï‚§ Report Center.
4. Page 4 â€“ UI Components Library
   o Buttons (primary, secondary, alert).
   o Cards (KPI, AI Recommendation, Action Plan).
   o Graphs (heatmap, progress bar, word cloud widget).
   o Modals (confirmation, AI suggestions).
5. Page 5 â€“ High Fidelity UI Screens
   o Fully designed versions of each wireframe.
   o Incorporate branding (colors, logos, typography).
   o Apply interactions (hover, states).
6. Page 6 â€“ Interactive Prototype
   o Link all high-fidelity screens to simulate user flows:
   ï‚§ Admin creating survey â†’ Employee responding â†’ AI analysis â†’ Leader taking action.

âœ… 3. Figma Flow (Prototype Links)
The Figma prototype should simulate:

1. Start â†’ Login â†’ Role-specific Dashboard.
2. Admin â†’ Creates Survey â†’ Launches â†’ Employee responds â†’ AI processes â†’ Admin receives insights.
3. Leader â†’ Launches Microclimate â†’ Live results â†’ AI recommends actions.
4. Admin/Leader â†’ Creates Plans â†’ Tracking (KPIs + feedback) â†’ AI adjusts and triggers follow-up microclimate.
5. Super Admin â†’ Compares Benchmarks â†’ Downloads Reports.
