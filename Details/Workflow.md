‚úÖ Workflow & Module Work Scheme for the Organizational Climate & Culture Platform
Based on the new diagram you uploaded and all previous specifications, I have developed a complete workflow that integrates:

1. User journeys (Sign-up ‚Üí Role assignment ‚Üí Access to dashboards/modules).
2. Module interactions (Surveys, AI Engine, Action Plans, Microclimates, Reporting).
3. Continuous Improvement Cycle (AI feedback loop with microclimates and qualitative/quantitative tracking).

üîÑ 1. High-Level Workflow
Step 1: User Onboarding & Role Assignment
‚Ä¢ Sign-up/Login via secure authentication (SSO/JWT).
‚Ä¢ User role is determined (Super Admin, Admin, Leader, Supervisor, Employee).
‚Ä¢ Redirect to role-specific dashboard.

---

Step 2: Company & Data Setup (Super Admin Flow)
‚Ä¢ Create/configure company profiles.
‚Ä¢ Upload demographics (departments, roles, locations).
‚Ä¢ Define industry benchmarks and categories.
‚Ä¢ Set up Question Bank.

---

Step 3: Climate Evaluation Flow
‚Ä¢ Admin builds and launches General Climate Survey.
‚Ä¢ Employees receive invitations, complete surveys.
‚Ä¢ AI Engine:
o Analyzes quantitative results (scores, KPIs).
o Processes qualitative feedback (sentiment analysis, topic extraction).
‚Ä¢ Results flow into Dashboards segmented by demographics.

---

Step 4: Microclimate Real-Time Evaluation
‚Ä¢ Leaders trigger on-demand microclimates for specific areas.
‚Ä¢ Responses populate real-time dashboards (heatmaps, word clouds).
‚Ä¢ AI Engine generates instant insights.

---

Step 5: Action Plan & Follow-up Module
‚Ä¢ AI Engine recommends action plans based on low-scoring areas.
‚Ä¢ Admins/Leaders customize plans (quantitative KPIs + qualitative objectives).
‚Ä¢ Plans are assigned with:
o Responsible person.
o Deadline.
o Expected impact.
‚Ä¢ Follow-up microclimates are scheduled to measure progress.

---

Step 6: Tracking & Feedback Cycle
‚Ä¢ Quantitative Tracking Node: Monitors KPI progress (% achieved).
‚Ä¢ Qualitative Tracking Node: Collects perception feedback during execution.
‚Ä¢ AI Feedback Cycle:
o Detects lack of progress.
o Suggests adjustments or new actions.
o Triggers new microclimates when necessary.

---

Step 7: Reporting & Continuous Improvement
‚Ä¢ Reports generated by Report Center (PDF/Excel, AI summaries).
‚Ä¢ Data feeds back into:
o Question Bank (updated with new AI-suggested items).
o Benchmark Manager.
o Future evaluations for continuous improvement.
