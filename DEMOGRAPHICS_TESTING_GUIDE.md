## Testing Checklist

### 1. Admin Demographics Configuration
**Page:** `/admin/demographics`

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Access control - only company_admin and super_admin can access
- [ ] View all demographic fields for company
- [ ] Create new field (text type)
- [ ] Create new field (select type with options)
- [ ] Create new field (number type)
- [ ] Create new field (date type)
- [ ] Edit existing field label
- [ ] Edit field options (select type)
- [ ] Toggle field required status
- [ ] Reorder fields (move up/down)
- [ ] Toggle field active/inactive
- [ ] Delete field (should soft delete)
- [ ] Field key validation (lowercase, underscores only)
- [ ] Duplicate field key prevention
- [ ] Empty option validation for select fields

**Expected UI Elements:**
- Statistics cards (Total Fields, Active, Inactive, Select Fields)
- Add Field button
- Fields table with:
  - Order controls (up/down arrows)
  - Label, Key, Type, Options columns
  - Required indicator
  - Status toggle switch
  - Edit and Delete buttons
- Create/Edit dialog with:
  - Label input
  - Field key input (disabled on edit)
  - Type selector
  - Options manager (for select type)
  - Required checkbox
- Delete confirmation dialog

### 2. CSV Upload System

#### Test Template Download:
```bash
# Navigate to /admin/demographics or survey creation demographics tab
# Click "Download Template" button
# Verify CSV contains:
# - Header row with 'email' and all company demographic fields
# - Example row showing format
```

#### Test CSV Upload Preview:
```csv
# Create test file: test_demographics.csv
email,gender,age_group,location,department
user1@company.com,Male,25-34,New York,Engineering
user2@company.com,Female,35-44,San Francisco,Sales
invalid-email,Male,25-34,Boston,Marketing
user4@company.com,InvalidGender,25-34,Chicago,HR
```

**Expected Results:**
- Total rows: 4
- Valid rows: 2
- Errors: 
  - Row 3: Invalid email format
  - Row 4: Invalid value for gender field
- Fields found: gender, age_group, location, department

#### Test CSV Upload Execution:
- [ ] Upload valid CSV
- [ ] Verify success message with updated count
- [ ] Check users in database have demographics populated
- [ ] Upload CSV with missing users
- [ ] Verify "not found" count in response
- [ ] Upload CSV with invalid data
- [ ] Verify validation errors returned
- [ ] Test with large file (near 10MB limit)
- [ ] Test file size limit (>10MB should fail)
- [ ] Test with .xlsx Excel file
- [ ] Test with .xls Excel file

### 3. Survey Creation Flow

**Navigate to:** `/surveys/create`

#### Test Demographics Tab:
- [ ] Demographics tab appears between Targeting and Invitations
- [ ] Demographics tab is locked until Targeting is completed
- [ ] Demographics tab unlocks after selecting departments
- [ ] Can select individual demographic fields
- [ ] Can select all fields
- [ ] Can deselect all fields
- [ ] Selected count displays correctly
- [ ] Info message shows "will be auto-populated"
- [ ] CSV upload section appears
- [ ] Can download template
- [ ] Can upload CSV
- [ ] CSV preview shows before upload
- [ ] CSV upload updates user demographics
- [ ] Tab navigation works (previous/next)
- [ ] Demographics tab has checkmark when fields selected
- [ ] Save draft includes demographic_field_ids
- [ ] Publish survey includes demographic_field_ids

### 4. Survey Response Auto-Population

**Create test survey with demographics:**
1. Create survey with 2-3 questions
2. Select 3-4 demographic fields (gender, age_group, location)
3. Publish survey

**Test auto-population:**
- [ ] Navigate to survey respond page: `/surveys/[id]/respond`
- [ ] Verify user's demographics are fetched from User model
- [ ] Verify demographic field definitions are fetched
- [ ] Submit survey response
- [ ] Verify demographics are included in response payload
- [ ] Check database - SurveyResponse should have demographics field
- [ ] Test with user who has NO demographics set
- [ ] Test with user who has partial demographics
- [ ] Test with user who has all demographics

**Expected Behavior:**
- Demographics auto-populated silently (no UI shown to user)
- User answers questions normally
- On submit, demographics automatically included
- No additional friction for respondent

### 5. API Testing

#### Create Field API:
```bash
POST /api/demographics/fields
{
  "company_id": "...",
  "field": "gender",
  "label": "Gender",
  "type": "select",
  "options": ["Male", "Female", "Other", "Prefer not to say"],
  "required": false
}
```

**Expected:** 201 Created, field returned

#### Update Field API:
```bash
PUT /api/demographics/fields/[id]
{
  "label": "Gender Identity",
  "required": true
}
```

**Expected:** 200 OK, updated field returned

#### Toggle Active API:
```bash
PATCH /api/demographics/fields/[id]
{
  "is_active": false
}
```

**Expected:** 200 OK, field deactivated

#### Reorder Fields API:
```bash
POST /api/demographics/fields/reorder
{
  "company_id": "...",
  "field_orders": [
    { "id": "field1_id", "order": 0 },
    { "id": "field2_id", "order": 1 },
    { "id": "field3_id", "order": 2 }
  ]
}
```

**Expected:** 200 OK, order updated

#### Upload Preview API:
```bash
POST /api/demographics/upload/preview
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: demographics.csv
company_id: "..."
```

**Expected:** 200 OK, preview with validation results

#### Upload Execute API:
```bash
POST /api/demographics/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: demographics.csv
company_id: "..."
```

**Expected:** 200 OK, update count and errors

## Performance Testing

### Load Tests:
- [ ] Create 50 demographic fields
- [ ] Upload CSV with 10,000 users
- [ ] Create survey with all 50 fields
- [ ] Collect 1,000 responses with demographics
- [ ] Query/filter responses by demographics

**Expected Performance:**
- Field creation: < 500ms
- CSV upload (10k users): < 30 seconds
- Survey response submission: < 1 second
- Results filtering: < 2 seconds

---

## Security Testing

### Authorization Tests:
- [ ] Employee role cannot access `/admin/demographics`
- [ ] Supervisor role cannot access `/admin/demographics`
- [ ] Company admin can only see their company's fields
- [ ] Company admin cannot see other company fields
- [ ] Super admin can see all companies
- [ ] CSV upload only updates users in same company
- [ ] Field queries filtered by company_id

### Input Validation:
- [ ] SQL injection attempts (field names, options)
- [ ] XSS attempts in labels and options
- [ ] Path traversal in CSV uploads
- [ ] Malicious file uploads
- [ ] CSRF protection on POST/PUT/DELETE
- [ ] Rate limiting on upload endpoints

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Hard Delete Not Implemented**
   - DELETE endpoint does soft delete (sets is_active = false)
   - Hard delete commented out to prevent data loss
   - Future: Add usage check before hard delete

2. **No Field Usage Statistics**
   - Cannot see which surveys use which fields
   - Future: Add usage_count field and track

3. **No Field Dependencies**
   - All fields independent
   - Future: Add conditional fields (show X if Y = value)

4. **No Validation Rules**
   - Beyond type and required
   - Future: Add regex, min/max, custom validators

5. **Dashboard Filtering Not Implemented**
   - Demographics collected but not used in results filtering yet
   - Task for future sprint

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise in production:

1. **Disable Demographics Tab:**
   - Set `FEATURE_DEMOGRAPHICS=false` in env
   - Demographics tab won't appear in survey creation

2. **Disable CSV Upload:**
   - Comment out upload endpoints
   - Keep field selection working

3. **Disable Auto-Population:**
   - Remove demographics from SurveyResponseFlow submission
   - Keep collecting questions only

4. **Revert Database Changes:**
   - Demographics are optional, no migration needed
   - Can leave existing data in place

---

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly:
- Monitor CSV upload errors
- Check demographic field usage
- Review validation error patterns

### Monthly:
- Audit inactive fields (candidates for deletion)
