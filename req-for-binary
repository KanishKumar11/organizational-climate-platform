Title: Binary (Yes/No) response with conditional comment

Short description:
When configuring a binary (Yes/No) question, the system must allow enabling an option so that if the answer is “Yes,” a text field appears for the respondent to provide an explanation/comment.

Functional requirements:

In the question builder, when selecting Type: Binary (Yes/No), show a setting:

“Require text if the answer is ‘Yes’” (ON/OFF).

If this option is ON:

Selecting “Yes” in the survey reveals a text field right below.

Selecting “No” does not show the text field.

Configurable parameters for the text field (in the builder):

Label (e.g., “Please explain your answer”)

Placeholder

Max length (characters)

Required (make the text mandatory when the answer is “Yes”)

Validations (min characters, text only, etc.).

Preview and runtime must reflect the behavior.

Data & reporting: export the comment in a dedicated field/column (e.g., Comment (if Yes)).

Acceptance criteria:

For a Binary (Yes/No) question with “Require text
