# Survey Response Route Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the missing `/surveys/:id/respond` route for the survey response functionality. This route allows users to respond to surveys, similar to how the microclimate response flow works.

## Files Created

### 1. **Survey Response Page**

**Location:** `src/app/surveys/[id]/respond/page.tsx`

Server-side rendered page that:

- Validates user authentication and permissions
- Checks if survey can accept responses (active status, within date range)
- Fetches survey data from database
- Displays appropriate error messages for inaccessible surveys
- Renders the SurveyResponseFlow component

**Features:**

- Access control based on company_id
- Survey availability validation (status, start/end dates)
- Support for invitation tokens
- Comprehensive error handling
- SEO-friendly metadata generation

### 2. **Survey Response Flow Component**

**Location:** `src/components/surveys/SurveyResponseFlow.tsx`

Client-side component that:

- Displays survey introduction screen
- Implements question-by-question navigation
- Handles various question types (likert, multiple_choice, yes/no, emoji_scale, open_ended, ranking)
- Shows progress bar
- Validates required questions
- Submits responses to API

**Features:**

- Smooth animations between questions
- Progress tracking
- Response validation
- Support for all question types defined in the Survey model
- Partial response capability
- Anonymous response support

## API Integration

Uses existing API endpoint:

- **POST** `/api/surveys/:id/responses` - Already implemented and working
- Handles response submission, validation, and storage
- Updates survey response count
- Manages invitation token tracking

## Supported Question Types

1. **Likert Scale** - 1-5 (or custom) rating scale
2. **Multiple Choice** - Radio button selection
3. **Yes/No** - Binary choice
4. **Emoji Scale** - Emoji-based rating
5. **Open Ended** - Text area for long responses
6. **Ranking** - Multiple checkbox selections
7. **Rating** - Numeric scale with labels

## User Flow

1. User navigates to `/surveys/:id/respond?token=xxx` (optional token)
2. Page validates:
   - User authentication
   - Survey accessibility
   - Survey active status
   - Current date within survey period
3. Shows introduction screen with survey details
4. User clicks "Start Survey"
5. Progresses through questions one-by-one
6. Can navigate back/forth between questions
7. Submits completed survey
8. Redirects to survey results page

## Error Handling

- **Not authenticated**: Returns 404 (notFound)
- **No permission**: Returns 404 (notFound)
- **Survey inactive**: Shows warning screen with status
- **Survey outside date range**: Shows date information
- **Missing required answers**: Toast notification
- **Submission failure**: Error toast with retry option

## Configuration Options

Respects survey settings:

- `anonymous`: Hides user identity in responses
- `show_progress`: Displays progress bar and question count
- `allow_partial_responses`: Enables save-and-continue functionality

## Route Access

The route is now available at:

```
/surveys/:id/respond
```

Optional query parameter:

```
?token=invitation_token
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Access control validation
- [ ] Survey status checking (draft, active, paused, completed, archived)
- [ ] Date range validation
- [ ] All question type rendering
- [ ] Response submission
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Required question validation
- [ ] Navigation (next/previous)
- [ ] Anonymous vs authenticated responses
- [ ] Invitation token handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the route with a real survey
2. Verify all question types render correctly
3. Test response submission to API
4. Validate error states
5. Test with invitation tokens
6. Add integration tests

## Notes

- Modeled after the working microclimate response flow
- Uses existing API endpoints (no backend changes needed)
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Accessible UI components from shadcn/ui
