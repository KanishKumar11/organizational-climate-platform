## 🔄 **Complete Microclimate Workflow**

### **1. Data Sources & Setup**

**For Testing (Current State):**
- ✅ All data is seeded and ready
- ✅ Test users created across all departments
- ✅ Templates and questions available

**For Production:**
- **User Registration**: Users register with email → Company auto-created from domain
- **Admin Setup**: Company admins use `/admin` interface to create departments and manage users
- **Organic Growth**: System supports natural company growth through registration
- **Seeding Option**: Use seeding scripts for initial setup or demos

### **2. Microclimate Creation Process**

1. **Leader Login**: Any user with `leader` role or higher
2. **Navigate to Creation**: Access microclimate creation interface
3. **Department Selection**: System calls `/api/departments/for-targeting` (✅ **FIXED**)
   - Leaders see ALL company departments (not just their own)
   - Enables effective cross-departmental targeting
4. **Configuration**: Select departments, set questions, configure settings
5. **Save**: Microclimate created in `draft` status

### **3. Microclimate Activation Process**

1. **Leader Activates**: Clicks activate button
2. **System Processing**: `/api/microclimates/[id]/activate` endpoint:
   - Generates invite list based on targeting criteria
   - Creates `MicroclimateInvitation` records for each user
   - Sends email notifications via notification service
   - Sends in-app notifications
   - Sets up WebSocket rooms for real-time updates
3. **Status Change**: Microclimate status changes to `active`

### **4. User Participation Process**

1. **Invitation Received**: Users get email with secure token link
2. **Landing Page**: `/microclimates/invitation/[token]` validates and shows invitation
3. **Accept Invitation**: User clicks accept, routed to `/microclimates/[id]/respond`
4. **Response Submission**: User completes survey, data saved via `/api/microclimates/[id]/responses`
5. **Status Tracking**: Invitation status updated throughout process
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket provides live participation updates

### **5. Real-time Features**

- **Live Participation Counts**: Leaders see real-time response numbers
- **Status Updates**: Invitation status tracking (pending → sent → opened → started → participated)
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for all participants

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Ready-to-Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Basic Microclimate Creation**
```bash
1. Login: test@techcorp.com / password123 (leader)
2. Navigate to microclimate creation
3. Verify: All 9 departments visible in dropdown
4. Create microclimate targeting Engineering + Design departments
5. Activate microclimate
6. Verify: Invitations sent to targeted users
```

**Scenario 2: Cross-Department Targeting**
```bash
1. Login: diana@techcorp.com / password123 (Design leader)
2. Create microclimate targeting Marketing + Sales + HR
3. Verify: Can see and select departments outside own hierarchy
4. Activate and test invitation flow
```

**Scenario 3: User Participation**
```bash
1. Create microclimate as leader
2. Login as alice@techcorp.com / password123 (employee)
3. Check for invitation notification
4. Complete microclimate response
5. Verify real-time updates for leader
```

## 🛠️ **Management Commands**

```bash
# System Status
npm run status:microclimate          # Check complete system status

# Data Management
npm run create:test-users            # Create additional test users
npm run add:departments              # Add sample departments
npm run test:targeting               # Test department targeting access

# Seeding
npm run seed:companies               # Seed companies and departments
npm run seed:questions               # Seed question bank
npm run seed:user                    # Create test user

# Debugging
npm run debug:departments            # Debug department issues
```

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **Required Environment Variables:**
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Authentication secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Application URL
- Email service configuration (for invitations)

### **Deployment Steps:**
1. **Database Setup**: MongoDB with proper indexes
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set all required variables
3. **Initial Seeding**: Run question bank and template seeding
4. **Company Onboarding**: Use registration or admin interface
5. **User Management**: Via registration or admin import

### **Data Growth Patterns:**
- **Organic**: Users register → Companies auto-created → Admins set up departments
- **Managed**: Admin creates company → Sets up departments → Imports/invites users
- **Hybrid**: Combination of both approaches

## ✅ **System Status: READY FOR TESTING**

**All core functionality is implemented and working:**
- ✅ Department targeting (fixed permission issue)
- ✅ Microclimate creation and activation
- ✅ Complete invitation system with secure tokens
- ✅ User participation flow
- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Notification system (email + in-app)
- ✅ Comprehensive test data across all departments
- ✅ Admin interfaces for ongoing management

**The microclimate system is production-ready and fully functional!**
