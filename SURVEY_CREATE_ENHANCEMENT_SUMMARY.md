```

// Now includes ALL settings when creating survey:
{
  // ... basic info
  department_ids: targetDepartments, // ✅ Now populated!
  settings: {
    notification_settings: {
      send_invitations: sendImmediately,
      send_reminders: reminderEnabled,
      reminder_frequency_days: reminderFrequency,
    },
    invitation_settings: {
      custom_message: customMessage,
      custom_subject: customSubject,
      include_credentials: includeCredentials,
      send_immediately: sendImmediately,
      branding_enabled: brandingEnabled,
    },
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Management:**
```typescript
// Added comprehensive state for all new features:
const [targetDepartments, setTargetDepartments] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [customMessage, setCustomMessage] = useState('');
const [customSubject, setCustomSubject] = useState('');
const [includeCredentials, setIncludeCredentials] = useState(false);
const [sendImmediately, setSendImmediately] = useState(true);
const [brandingEnabled, setBrandingEnabled] = useState(true);
const [reminderEnabled, setReminderEnabled] = useState(true);
const [reminderFrequency, setReminderFrequency] = useState(3);
```

### **Component Architecture:**
```
/surveys/create
├── Header (Gradient with actions)
├── Tabs
│   ├── Builder (Basic info + questions)
│   ├── Library (QuestionLibraryBrowser)
│   ├── Targeting (DepartmentSelector) ← NEW
│   ├── Invitations (InvitationSettings) ← NEW
│   ├── Schedule (SurveyScheduler)
│   ├── Preview (Complete summary) ← ENHANCED
