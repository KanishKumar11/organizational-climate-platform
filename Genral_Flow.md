âœ… 3. Figma Flow (Prototype Links)
The Figma prototype should simulate:

1. Start â†’ Login â†’ Role-specific Dashboard.
2. Admin â†’ Creates Survey â†’ Launches â†’ Employee responds â†’ AI processes â†’ Admin receives insights.
3. Leader â†’ Launches Microclimate â†’ Live results â†’ AI recommends actions.
4. Admin/Leader â†’ Creates Plans â†’ Tracking (KPIs + feedback) â†’ AI adjusts and triggers follow-up microclimate.
5. Super Admin â†’ Compares Benchmarks â†’ Downloads Reports.
