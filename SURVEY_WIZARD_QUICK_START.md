## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Draft Not Saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're logged in (session required)
- Check network tab for API call failures
- Try manual "Save Draft" button

### Question Library Empty
- Categories may not be seeded
- Run: `npm run seed` (if seeding script exists)
- Check API response in network tab

### Preload Data Not Loading
- Ensure company is selected
- Check network tab for API calls to:
  - `/api/companies/[id]/departments`
  - `/api/companies/[id]/users`
- Verify user has permission to access company data

### QR Code Not Generating
- Ensure `qrcode` package is installed
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify survey ID and URL are valid

### Session Expires Too Quickly
- Adjust session timeout in NextAuth configuration
- Consider implementing refresh tokens
- Increase warning thresholds in code

## üìù Best Practices

### Creating Surveys
1. **Start with clear title** - Be specific (e.g., "Q4 2024 Employee Engagement")
2. **Add description** - Explain purpose to help yourself later
3. **Choose questions carefully** - Use library to ensure consistency
4. **Target appropriately** - Don't spam all employees unnecessarily
5. **Set realistic timeframes** - Give enough time for completion
6. **Test QR codes** - Scan to verify URL works before distributing

### Using Drafts
1. **Save frequently** - Don't rely only on autosave
2. **Name surveys descriptively** - Makes recovery easier
3. **Restore promptly** - Drafts expire after 7 days
4. **Clear old drafts** - Discard if no longer needed

### Question Library
1. **Use categories** - Organize questions logically
2. **Add tags** - Makes searching easier
3. **Preview before adding** - Check both EN and ES versions
4. **Reuse popular questions** - Builds consistency across surveys
