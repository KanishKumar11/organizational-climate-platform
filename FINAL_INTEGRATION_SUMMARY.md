## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic approach** - Directory-by-directory analysis ensured nothing was missed
2. **Consistent patterns** - Using tabs and dialogs made integration predictable
3. **TypeScript strict mode** - Caught errors early in development
4. **Component modularity** - Well-designed components were easy to integrate
5. **Documentation** - Clear prop interfaces made integration straightforward

### Challenges Overcome

1. **GapAnalysisReport props** - Required specific context not available at page level
   - Solution: Created placeholder with navigation guidance
2. **Named vs default exports** - Some components had different export types
   - Solution: Checked each component and used correct import syntax
3. **State management** - Managing complex state across tabs and dialogs
   - Solution: Lifted state to page level, passed via props
