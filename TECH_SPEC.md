Climate Culture Platform – Technical Specification

1.  Overview & Purpose
    The Climate Culture Platform is designed to measure, analyze, and improve organizational culture
    through AI-driven questionnaires and adaptive evaluation. It addresses the critical business problem of
    fragmented cultural insights by enabling continuous assessment across departments and
    demographics. The system operates as a feedback loop: collect → analyze → recommend → act →
    re-measure.
2.  Roles & Permissions
    The platform defines four hierarchical roles with scoped permissions:
    Role
    Permissions

3.  Questionnaire System
    The platform maintains a pool of 200+ questions covering climate, culture, and microclimates. The AI
    dynamically adapts these questions by combining, reformulating, or generating new variations. It has
    access to both historical and newly created questions for contextual adaptability.

5.  Admin creates or imports new questions into the pool.
6.  Admin sends invitation links to selected users.
7.  Users complete adaptive questionnaires.
8.  Demographics may be updated by admins before, during, or after completion.
9.  AI re-analyzes responses when demographics are changed.
10. Results can be filtered by demographics at each admin level.
11. Data Flows & User Interactions
    Survey responses flow into the AI engine → demographic filters are applied → insights generated →
    dashboards display scoped data depending on role permissions. Demographics edits trigger
    recomputation of insights, while scoping ensures admins only see authorized data.
