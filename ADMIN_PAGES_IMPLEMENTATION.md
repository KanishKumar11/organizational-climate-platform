# Admin Pages Implementation - Complete Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The navigation was showing `/users` and `/departments` links that led to 404 errors. I've implemented these missing pages using the existing admin components and API endpoints.

## ✅ **What's Now Available**

### **1. User Management Page** (`/users`)
- **Full user management interface** with existing `UserManagement` component
- **Role-based access control** - Super admins and company admins only
- **Features available:**
  - View all users with role, department, and status
  - Search and filter users
  - Create, edit, and deactivate users
  - Bulk operations and user export
  - Department assignment

### **2. Department Management Page** (`/departments`)
- **Complete department hierarchy management** with existing `DepartmentHierarchy` component
- **Role-based access control** - Super admins and company admins only
- **Features available:**
  - View hierarchical department structure
  - Create, edit, and delete departments
  - Manage parent-child relationships
  - Move departments in hierarchy
  - View user counts per department

### **3. Existing Admin Pages**

## 📊 **Current Data Status**

**Your system is fully populated and ready:**
- **17 active users** across different roles
- **9 active departments** with proper hierarchy
- **2 active companies** (Gmail.com Organization, Kanishkumar.in Organization)
- **Complete role distribution**: 8 employees, 5 leaders, 2 supervisors, 2 super admins

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **As Super Admin:**

1. **User Management:**
   - Navigate to `/users` or click "Users" in sidebar under "Organization"
   - View all users across all companies
   - Create new users, assign roles and departments

2. **Department Management:**
   - Navigate to `/departments` or click "Departments" in sidebar under "Organization"

3. **Company Management:**

4. **Microclimate Creation:**
