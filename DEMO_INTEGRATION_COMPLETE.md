---

## üö´ Intentionally Skipped

### Charts Showcase (`/demo/charts`)

**Reason for Skipping:**
The charts demo page is a component library showcase, not a user-facing feature. It demonstrates various chart types (AnimatedBarChart, LineChart, PieChart, HeatMap, WordCloud) but doesn't serve a specific business purpose in production.

**Alternative Approach:**
- Chart components are already available throughout the app
- Used in Reports, Benchmarks, Dashboard, AI Insights
- If needed, can create `/docs/components` for internal developer reference
- Consider Storybook for comprehensive component documentation

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **Skip production integration** (component library demo only)

---

## üìñ Migration Guide for Remaining Demo Features

### For Developers

If additional demo features need to be promoted to production in the future:

**Step 1: Audit Demo Page**
```bash
# Read the demo page source
code src/app/demo/[feature]/page.tsx

# Identify unique components
grep -r "import.*from.*components" src/app/demo/[feature]/page.tsx
```

**Step 2: Check Production Status**
```bash
# Search for production route
find src/app -name "page.tsx" | grep [feature]

# Search for components in production
grep -r "ComponentName" src/app --exclude-dir=demo
```

**Step 3: Create or Enhance Production Page**
```typescript
// Import demo components
import { DemoComponent } from '@/components/[category]/DemoComponent';

// Add to existing page or create new route
export default function ProductionPage() {
  return (
    <DashboardLayout>
      <DemoComponent {...props} />
    </DashboardLayout>
  );
}
```

**Step 4: Update Navigation**
```typescript
// Edit: src/components/navigation/RoleBasedNav.tsx
sections.push({
  title: 'Section Name',
  items: [
    {
      label: 'Feature Name',
      href: '/feature-route',
      icon: IconComponent,
      description: 'Feature description',
    },
  ],
});
```

**Step 5: Add Authorization**
```typescript
// Check user permissions
const { user, canAccessFeature } = useAuth();

if (!canAccessFeature) {
  return <AccessDenied />;
}
```
