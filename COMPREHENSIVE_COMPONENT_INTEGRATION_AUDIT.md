## 🔧 Integration Patterns Used

### 1. Tabbed Interface Pattern
**Used in:** Action Plans, Benchmarks, Reports, Survey Create

**Benefits:**
- Clean navigation
- Preserves context
- Easy to extend
- Consistent UX

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="tab1">Tab 1</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="tab2">Tab 2</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="tab1">{/* Content */}</TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="tab2">{/* Content */}</TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### 2. Dialog Modal Pattern
**Used in:** AI Insights, Dashboard

**Benefits:**
- Non-intrusive
- Focused interaction
- Easy dismissal
- Scroll handling

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<Dialog open={showDialog} onOpenChange={setShowDialog}>
  <DialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button>Open</Button>
  </DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent className="max-w-2xl max-h-[80vh] overflow-y-auto">
    <Component onComplete={() => setShowDialog(false)} />
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### 3. Callback Pattern
**Used in:** All components

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling
- Event-driven
- Testable
- Composable

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<Component
  onSuccess={(result) => {
    toast.success('Operation complete');
    // Handle result
  }}
  onError={(error) => {
    toast.error(error.message);
  }}
  onCancel={() => {
    // Handle cancellation
  }}
/>
```

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### TypeScript Best Practices
All integrations follow TypeScript best practices:
- ✅ Explicit interface definitions
- ✅ No `any` types (except where necessary)
- ✅ Proper null/undefined handling
- ✅ Generic type parameters where appropriate
- ✅ Discriminated unions for state management

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Lazy loading for heavy components (QRCodeGeneratorLazy, etc.)
- ✅ Memoization for expensive calculations
- ✅ Virtualization for long lists
- ✅ Debouncing for search inputs
- ✅ Code splitting by route

### Accessibility Features
- ✅ ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus management in dialogs
- ✅ Screen reader announcements
- ✅ Color contrast compliance
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Component not rendering**
- Check import path is correct
- Verify component is exported (named vs default)
- Check props are passed correctly
- Verify user has permissions

**Issue 2: TypeScript errors**
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to see all errors
- Check interface definitions match usage
- Verify all required props are provided
- Check for type mismatches

**Issue 3: Build failures**
- Clear `.next` folder and rebuild
- Check for circular dependencies
- Verify all imports exist
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies

**Issue 4: Styling issues**
- Check Tailwind classes are correct
- Verify dark mode compatibility
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Check z-index layering
