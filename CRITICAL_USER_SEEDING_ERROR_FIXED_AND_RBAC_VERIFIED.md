# 🎉 **CRITICAL USER SEEDING ERROR FIXED & RBAC FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED**

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **🚨 Critical User Seeding Error - FIXED**
**Problem**: `role: 'hr_manager' is not a valid enum value for path 'role'` and `role: 'department_manager' is not a valid enum value for path 'role'`

**Root Cause**: The seed data was using role names that didn't exist in the USER_ROLES enum:
- ❌ `'hr_manager'` (not in enum)
- ❌ `'department_manager'` (not in enum)

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Fixed Role Mapping**: Changed `'hr_manager'` → `'department_admin'` (appropriate for HR management capabilities)
- ✅ **Fixed Role Mapping**: Changed `'department_manager'` → `'leader'` (appropriate for department leadership)
- ✅ **Updated Both Files**: Fixed roles in both `src/app/api/admin/seed-data/users/route.ts` and `src/lib/seedComprehensiveData.ts`
- ✅ **Updated Role Distribution**: Fixed summary statistics to use correct role names

**Valid USER_ROLES Enum**:
```typescript
export const USER_ROLES = {
  employee: 1,        // Basic user access
  supervisor: 2,      // Team supervision
  leader: 3,          // Department leadership  
  department_admin: 4, // Department administration (HR)
  company_admin: 5,   // Company-wide administration
  super_admin: 6,     // System-wide administration
} as const;
```
